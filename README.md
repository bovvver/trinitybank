## About the project
**Trinity Bank** is a full-stack project designed to simulate a real bank, developed using the **VILT** stack (Vue3 + Inertia + Laravel + TailwindCSS). It provides functionalities such as money transfers, card issuance, currency conversion, and more. The project integrates with an external CurrencyAPI and is secured using session-based authentication. Additionally, it connects to a mail server to handle email verification and password reset processes. Project will continue to be developed.
